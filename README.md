# ⚖️ VerdictLens  
### *AI-Powered Court Case Outcome Prediction and Alimony Evaluation System*

---

## 📘 Overview  
**VerdictLens** is an AI-powered decision-support system designed to assist in predicting **court case outcomes** and estimating **alimony or compensation** using advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques.  
It focuses on **family law cases** (divorce, maintenance, custody) by analyzing thousands of Indian court judgments to extract meaningful insights and predictions.

The system leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Hugging Face transformers** for deep contextual understanding of legal documents, enabling it to capture complex judicial reasoning and predict outcomes more accurately.

## 🚀 Current Status  
> **Development Stage:** 🛠️ *In Progress*  
- Requirement analysis and data collection are complete.  
- Data preprocessing and LLM integration are ongoing.  
- Model training, regression-based alimony prediction, and frontend-backend integration are under active development.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Predict likely **court outcomes** using past judgments.  
- Estimate **alimony or compensation** based on financial and social parameters.  
- Provide a **transparent and explainable AI model** for judicial decision support.  
- Enable **data-driven insights** for legal researchers, advocates, and policymakers.  
- Integrate **LLMs and Hugging Face models** for enhanced contextual accuracy.

## 🧩 System Architecture  

1. **Data Collection & Processing**
   - Extracts and scrapes data from public legal repositories like *Indian Kanoon* and *eCourts*.
   - Performs OCR on scanned judgments and text cleaning.
   - Uses NLP techniques to extract entities like income, dependents, and case outcomes.

2. **Prediction & Evaluation**
   - Uses classification models for **outcome prediction**.
   - Employs regression and rule-based models for **alimony estimation**.
   - Incorporates *Legal-BERT*, *DistilBERT*, and other Hugging Face LLMs for deeper semantic analysis.

3. **User Interface (Planned)**
   - Intuitive dashboard built using **React.js** and **Node.js**.
   - Backend integrated with **Python (Flask/FastAPI)** ML microservices.
   - Case analytics visualization using **MongoDB** and **REST APIs**.
